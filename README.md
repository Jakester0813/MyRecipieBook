# Bon Appetit

Bon Appetit is a Food and Nutrition App.

1. It notes down your daily meals and calculates different macros (Carbs, Protein, Fat, etc.) for you along with total calories intake.
(Speaking the meals is much convinient way to make notes instead of writing down meals)
Because of this feature; we beleive it will be a habit forming App.

2. It will provide you with practical recepies (quick, easy and healthy) which will help you stay in your daily calorie limit.
You can star your favorite recepies and also share it with your loved ones.

3. It will note your daily water content by clicking a button whenever you have a glass of water(trying to find a different way of doing this)

4. It will automatically parse the ingredients from your starred recepies and will make a grocery list for you (Its Weekly; so there is maximum limit to star recepies per week)
